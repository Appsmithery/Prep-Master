# Syllabus (12 modules)

### **Materials**
1. CS2023 organizes CS into knowledge areas (e.g., algorithms, data management, OS, networking, security, software engineering), which we’ll use as the backbone of what to learn.   

2. SWEBOK v4 (latest; updated as v4.0a in Sep 2025) provides a consensus software engineering body of knowledge and explicitly integrates Agile/DevOps; it also adds Software Architecture, Software Engineering Operations, and Software Security as new knowledge areas.

Operating systems | Processes/threads, scheduling intuition, virtual memory, filesystems, syscalls, why resource leaks happen, what “load average” is actually signaling | OS  | Operations, Maintenance  [ieeexplore.ieee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343447/) | OSSU includes *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* in its core systems path.  [github](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) |
| 7. Networking + distributed basics | HTTP basics, DNS/TLS intuition, timeouts/retries, idempotency, consistency vs availability tradeoffs, why “it works locally” fails in prod | NC, PDC  | Architecture, Operations, Security  [ieeexplore.ieee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343447/) | OSSU’s core systems includes a networking course (Top-Down Approach) and uses labs to build practical protocol intuition.  [github](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) |
| 8. Security fundamentals | Threat modeling mindset, authn/authz, secrets handling, injection classes, supply chain risks, least privilege, why security is a product feature not a checklist | SEC  | Software Security (new KA), Requirements  [ieeexplore.ieee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343447/) | OSSU has a “Core security” sequence and also lists a “Secure Software Development” series.  [github](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) |
| 9. Requirements → architecture | Turning messy goals into testable requirements, designing interfaces and boundaries, managing non-functional requirements (latency, cost, availability), avoiding “architecture astronaut” docs | SE, SDF, SF  | Requirements, Architecture (new KA), Design  [ieeexplore.ieee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343447/) | SWEBOK v4 explicitly elevates Architecture and ties it to operations/security as first-class concerns.  [ieeexplore.ieee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343447/) |
| 10. Testing, quality, and release confidence | Unit/integration/e2e mental models, test pyramid intuition, what coverage can’t tell you, release strategies (feature flags, canary), what “done” means in engineering | SE, SDF  | Testing, Quality, Engineering Management  [ieeexplore.ieee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343447/) | OSSU’s core programming track emphasizes design for testing and unit testing as foundational skills.  [github](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) |

Reliability + observability (pragmatic SRE) | SLO/SLI basics, alerting vs paging, error budgets intuition, incident lifecycle, and how monitoring links to product decisions | PDC, SF  | Operations (new KA), Management  [ieeexplore.ieee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343447/) | Google’s free online *Site Reliability Engineering* book covers SLOs, monitoring, release engineering, and “eliminating toil” as core topics.  [sre](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/) |
| 12. AI features + lightweight LLM Ops | What “agent/tool/RAG” means, prompt/version control, evals, tracing/cost controls, and how to ship AI safely with fallback behaviors and human review | AI, SEP (ethics)  | Quality, Security, Professional Practice  [ieeexplore.ieee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343447/) | “Prompt Problems” formalizes prompt-based exercises as a way to learn programming concepts in the generative AI era.

### How to use this as a PM
Your goal isn’t to become a SWE; it’s to be able to (1) write crisp requirements, (2) evaluate tradeoffs, (3) spot risk early, and (4) communicate precisely with engineers.  
CS2023 gives you the breadth of “what exists,” while SWEBOK v4 gives you the lifecycle and professional practices that determine whether software ships reliably. [ieeexplore.ieee](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10343447/)

### Free learning spine (minimal shopping list)
If you want one coherent, free “playlist” to draw from, OSSU’s computer science curriculum is explicitly designed as a complete CS grounding using free online materials and includes tools, systems, theory, security, databases, and ethics. [github](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
For reliability/production thinking, Google’s SRE book is freely available online and its table of contents highlights core operational concepts like SLOs, monitoring, automation, and release engineering. [sre](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/)
For a structured intro option that’s free to start, CS50 can be audited on edX at no cost (paid track is optional). [edx](https://www.edx.org/cs50)
